Windows and Windows '95 users simply run the TK file located in the Netscape folder inside the COOLSOFT folder.  The Account Setup Wizard will offer you a list of Internet Service providers to choose from and will walk you through the easy installation process. <BR> Macintosh users can get Internet Access by contacting an Internet Service provider and asking for instructions on how to configure Netscape Navigator to run with the Provider's service.</td></tr><tr><td><b>America Online</b><br></td></tr><tr><td>America Online is offering new users a 15-hour free trial of their service!  Enclosed with this CD is a card with a registration number and password.  You'll need that to open up your free trial account.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Global Network Navigator (windows only)</b><br>Global Network Navigator is an Internet Service Provider, and they are offering a free trial on their system. Enclosed with this CD is a card with a registration number and password.  You'll need that to redeem your free trial.</td></tr></table><table width="90%" cellpadding="2"><tr><td><font size="5"><a name=cd>HOW TO LINK FROM THE CD TO THE INTERNET</a></font size></td></tr><tr><td>You do not need a modem or an Internet account to view the "24 Hours in Cyberspace" website included on this CD, however, if you do have Internet access there are links at the end of each of the stories on this CD that will take you from your computer out via the Internet to the people or places featured in these stories.</td></tr><tr><td>If you are currently a member of a commercial online service, such as America Online, you may not be able to connect directly from the CD to the Internet.  You will have to contact your commercial online service directly for instruction on how to configure that service to work with Netscape Navigator.</td></tr><tr><td>If you already have access to the Internet, turn on your modem, and open your Internet connection. By clicking on the links at the end of the story, the CD will connect you to the URL (computer address) you are looking for.  Because many of the addresses at the end of each story may be outdated (the Internet is constantly changing!), we have created a system that routes  you through our server which will hold the most recent addresses.  In any event, some of  the address may no longer exist (you will get an error message that says: Netscape is unable to locate the server.  The server does not have a DNS entry.) If you receive this message after clicking on a link it usually indicates that the web site no longer exists or is having temporary difficulty.</td></tr></table><HR><p><center><b><a href="toc_new.htm">Back to the Help Page</a></b><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>		<IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" align="center" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="34"><BR>		<IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" align="center" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10">			<BR><font><Font size="4">Please direct all inquiries to: <A HREF="mailto: cyber24rs@aol.com">cyber24rs@aol.com</A> <br></font><font size=2>&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
