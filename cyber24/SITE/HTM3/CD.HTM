You will have to contact your commercial online service directly for instruction on how to configure that service to work with Netscape Navigator.</td></tr><tr><td>If you already have access to the Internet, turn on your modem, and open your Internet connection. By clicking on the links at the end of the story, the CD will connect you to the URL (computer address) you are looking for.  Because many of the addresses at the end of each story may be outdated (the Internet is constantly changing!), we have created a system that routes  you through our server which will hold the most recent addresses.  In any event, some of  the address may no longer exist (you will get an error message that says: Netscape is unable to locate the server.  The server does not have a DNS entry.) If you receive this message after clicking on a link it usually indicates that the web site no longer exists or is having temporary difficulty.</td></tr></table><p><hr><center><b><a href="toc_new.htm">Back to the Help Page</a></b><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>		<IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" align="center" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" VSPACE="10"><BR>		<IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" align="center" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" HSPACE="10">		</td</tr>		<tr><td align="center"><Font size="4">Please direct all inquiries to: <A HREF="mailto: cyber24rs@aol.com">cyber24rs@aol.com</A> <br></font><font size=2>&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
