When my husband died after 45 years together, to say I was lost is an understatement. I cried all the time, played our music to make myself cry. To get all the tears out of me. I felt I would follow him soon, in fact I used to practice dying.---Sick no---I loved and missed my mate.<p>Then I thought I would get a computer to research my religion. My son who is a computer nerd (meant in the nicest way) started telling me about www and internet cyberspace. All this sounded like a foreign language to me. Then he used to come from Modesto to visit and to straighten out all the mistakes I made with my computer. Well this old fool had trouble remembering how to download, save a program, load a program. I spent quite a bit of time on the phone long distance with a million questions over and over. I'm sure he lost patience with me. Well, I started pushing buttons and pretty soon another world opened up for me. I still remember my moments of lonliness, of course. The crying is far between now. <p>I met a young lady in Australia by the name of Jane. She helped turn things around. It seems we both needed a friend at that time. I used to come home and the first thing I would do was turn on the machine and look to see if Jane wrote me. I have quite a few e-mail friends now and it's great. I try to see if I can go to bed early without turning on the computer....I can't. Its infectuous. It's like thrill and tickle in my tummy. Sound like an old fool, I don't think so. Whatever it takes is what you do !! I wish I could help other widows to see this is not just a toy game machine, it's a healing machine. More fun than going to the psychiatrist. When my husband died my daughter was on shaky ground emotionally. My husband's death caused the final blow and my daughter was over the edge. She had a nervous breakdown. She was in the hospital 3 or 4 times. She was on all kinds of medication. Doctors, nothing seemed to get through. She was a blank. Then it dawned on me, I'll buy her a computer and see if that will get through. At first her husband said she never touched it. I kept encouraging her and finally she decided to try a game then I kept telling her how to do research. I can't express how wonderful a tool this is. How wonderful for sick and lonely people. I tell everyone about it. I am very enthusiastic about it. I sound like a commercial. It's very infectuous. Yesterday I signed up for classes on Virtual University. It's great. There is so much I could talk for hours about it. What about the people who dedicate their time for the fun of it and to help people. There are so many nice people in cyberspace. It's like the old days when people were helpful and friendly. This is not the end of this little story IT'S THE BEGINNING! Now I talk the talk and walk the walk I'm the little old lady from California surfing the surf. <p>			<FONT SIZE="5">Betty Colgin<BR></FONT>			<FONT SIZE="4">Folsom, California<BR><BR><BR><BR>			</FONT>			<BR>PRIZE:  <A HREF="../htm3/wprizes.htm">DIGITAL ARTIST PACKAGE</A><BR>						</TD>								 			</TR>					</TABLE>	</BODY></HTML>
