By clicking on the links at the end of the story, the CD will connect you to the URL (Internet address) you are looking for.  Because many of the addresses at the end of each story may be outdated (the Internet is constantly changing!), we have created a system that routes  you through our server which will hold the most recent addresses.  In any event, some of  the address may no longer exist (you may get an error message that says "Netscape is unable to locate the server.  The server does not have a DNS entry.") If you receive this message after clicking on a link it usually indicates that the web site no longer exists or is experiencing problems.			</td>						</tr>	</table>	<p><center><b><a href="toc_new.htm">Back to the Help Page</a></b></center><table width=450>		<tr>			<td>						<center><BR><font><Font size="4">Please direct all inquiries to: <A HREF="mailto:cyber24rs@aol.com">cyber24rs@aol.com</A> <br></font><font size=2>&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
