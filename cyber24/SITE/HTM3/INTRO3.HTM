These images, captured by								1,000 professional and amateur photographers								dispatched to every continent, record how the online world								is	changing our lives. No picture here is more then 24 hours older or								younger	than any other. And every photograph								was shot for a single purpose: to document								the harmonies	and paradoxes of life in cyberspace as it was lived								on this one day.<p>								Cyberspace is no longer an abstraction: It is now the real world - the								marketplace, 								the battleground, the house of prayer, the secret retreat. It is a place where								we meet and where we venture alone. It's as comfortable and as boundless as the								street where we live, as wondrous and frightening as the first day of								kindergarten. We have yet to reach the borders of this brand-new place, and we								may well discover that it has none. In fact, on the day this project took place,								controversial legislation was signed into law that threatens the very freedom of speech								the Net has come to nurture.<p>																There are hundreds of photographs on this website, selected from the more than								200,000 shot on February 8. But even 200,000 images barely hint at the infinite								moments that passed through the hills and homes and hearts of humanity on that								day. On February 8, 1996, cyberspace was frozen in time, and for decades to								come, our children and our children's children will look with wonder at this								photographic record of an ordinary day when millions of people around the planet								took the time to paint their own names on the walls of the digital								cave.</font>								<p>															</td>							 						</tr>					</table>		<BR><MAP NAME="logo">	<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="18,38,115,78" HREF="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?kodak">	<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="176, 40,264,76" href="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?sun">	<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="327,28,370,88" HREF="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?adobe"></MAP>	<a href=toc.htm?about target="_top" ><img src=../assets/assets2/enterher.gif border=0><br><br><br><br></a>								<center><font size=+1>								This project was made possible through the generosity of:								</font></CENTER><img src=../assets/assets2/logos.gif USEMAP="#logo" border=0><center><font size=+1><a href="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?aol" target="_top" ><IMG SRC=../logos/aolenter.gif border=0></a><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="1"><a href="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?net" target="_top" ><IMG SRC=../logos/netenter.gif  border=0></a><br><br><br><a href="../sponsors/sponindx.htm?other" target="_top">And other leading companies</a></font></center><p><p><font size=2><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0" VSPACE=50><BR>Please direct all inquiries to: <BR>Against All Odds Productions<BR>P.O.
