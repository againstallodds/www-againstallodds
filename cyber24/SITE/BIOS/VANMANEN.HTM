He  wants the subjects' personality to shine through in his									pictures. "If you don't have any warmth to the shot you're not trying hard 									enough.  One of sadder signs in photojournalism these days, is everybody 									using fill flash so much, often times photographers are not even looking at 									the light."									<p>									"Best moments of a day in Cyberspace project was the good spirit 									Hofness was able to  maintain after being photographed in the darkest 									corners of a Victoria cemetary for two hours in the pouring rain...A man 									who is truly dedicated to his mission." When not working, he spends most 									days free skiing (fast as possible) downhill at nearby Whistler Mountain 									or the occasional trip to the French Alps.							<p>									Contact Information:<br>									Home phone: 604.921.9426<br>									cell phone: 604.329.2078<br>							</font>						</td>				</tr>				</table>		</td>	</tr></table></body></html>
