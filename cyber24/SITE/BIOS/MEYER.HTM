He has also contributed significantly today 									with his pioneering work to bridge the transition between traditional photography 									and digital-image making. His is probably the most complete body of digital 									photography done to date anywhere. His work has been widely published in different									magazines, books and periodicals. An anthology of his work <b>Tiempos de America</b> 									was published in Italy in 1985, in 1986 a second anthology of his work 									<b>Espejo de Espinas</b> was published in Mexico. In 1988 an essay on the Mexican Oil 									Workers <b>Los Cohetes Duraron Todo el Da</b> went to press in Mexico. <b>APERTURE</b> has 									recently published a book on his digital images under the title of <b>Truths & Fictions</b>. 								<p>									In 1991, the Voyager Co. published his first CD-ROM title <b>I Photograph to Remember</b> 									which today is already considered a classic, containing his images and narration, 									documenting the last years of his parents' life. In 1994 Meyer produced a second CD-ROM 									disc, <b>Truths & Fictions</b>. Both of these works form part of a world touring exhibition 									presented with large ink jet prints also made with the aid of computers. He is 									currently engaged in creating a web site called <b>zonezero</b> on the internet, which is 									dedicated to the work of other photographers throughout the world. His pictures have 									been  exhibited in over 120 collective exhibitions and more than 60 solo presentations. 									Over thirty of the most distinguished museums throughout the world collect his work. 									He has taught and lectured in numerous parts of the world. Recipient of awards both in 									Mexico and abroad, he has received grants among others, from the Guggenheim Foundation, 									the National Endowment for the Arts, and the Rockefeller Foundation.								<p>																Contact Information:<br>									<a href="mailto:pedro@zonezero.com">pedro@zonezero.com</A>												</font>						</td>				</tr>				</table>		</td>	</tr></table></body></html>
