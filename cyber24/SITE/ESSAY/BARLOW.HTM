On behalf of the future, I askyou of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. Youhave no sovereignty where we gather. <p>Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Youhave neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do notcome from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind.  <p>We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I addressyou with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself alwaysspeaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturallyindependent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moralright to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have truereason to fear.<p>You do not know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within yourborders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a publicconstruction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature, and it grows by itselfthrough our collective actions. <p>You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did youcreate the wealth of our gathering marketplaces. You do not know our culture,our ethics or the unwritten codes that already provide our society moreorder than could be obtained by any of your impositions. <p>You claim there are problems among us you need to solve. You use thisclaim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don'texist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we willidentify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own SocialContract. This governance will arise according to the conditions of ourworld, not yours. Our world is different.<p>Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships and thought itself,arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is aworld that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live. <p>We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudiceaccorded by race, economic power, military force or station of birth. <p>We are creating a world where anyone anywhere may express his or herbeliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silenceor conformity. <p>Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement and contextdo not apply to us. They are based on matter. There is no matter here. <p>Our identities have no bodies, so unlike you, we cannot obtain order byphysical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interestand our commonwealth our governance will emerge. Our identities may bedistributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all ourconstituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope wewill be able to  build our particular solutions on that basis. But we cannotaccept the solutions you are attempting to impose. <p>In the United States, you are creating a law, the Telecommunications ReformAct, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams ofJefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, deTocqueville and Brandeis. Thesedreams must now be born anew in us. <p>You are terrified of your own children since they are natives in a worldwhere you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust yourbureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly toconfront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions ofhumanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole;the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes fromthe air upon which wings beat. <p>In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts atthe frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a smalltime, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed inbit-bearing media.<p>Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselvesby proposing laws in America and elsewhere that claim to own speech itselfthroughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be another industrialproduct, no more noble than pig iron. In our world, whatever the human mindmay create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost. Theglobal conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish. <p>These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the sameposition as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who hadto reject the authority of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare ourvirtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to consent toyour rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the planet sono one can arrest our thoughts. <p> We will create civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humaneand fair than the world your governments have made before. <p>Davos, Switzerland<br>February 8th, 1996 					<p><BR><BR> 					<font size=2> 					John Perry Barlow is a retired Wyoming cattle rancher, a lyricist 					for the Grateful Dead 					and a cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.					</font>					<br><br><br><br><a href= ../htm3/tocslw.htm><IMG SRC=../assets/assets2/footers/leapessy.gif  align=center valign=top width=364 height=51 border=0></a>                 </td>        </tr> </table></td></tr></table><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>					<FONT SIZE=1>				<center><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0" VSPACE=50><BR>				&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
