For them and for potentially millions of others like them, Cyberspace is a not just a lifeline, it can be better than the offline world.<p>People who have never been online have a picture of what happens there thatis almost certainly wrong. Blame that on the mass media's lurid coverage. Dopeople deceive and steal and snoop and solicit online? Yes, of course.Pornography and pedophilia? I'm sure. But is there pornography and pedophiliain any American city? Of course there is. Is that all there is?  Of coursenot; there's the totality of human existence, high and low. The same is truefor Cyberspace.<p>During my 10 years online, I've danced at three weddings of people who metonline. I've spoken at three funerals of people I encountered there. Atbottom, Cyberspace is about people, not about machines and wires. And whatthe people who use it do after they find each other is a human phenomenon,not electrical engineering.<p>Consider Phil, a mainstay of the online parenting conference at The WELL, whorevealed one night four years ago that his son, known to all of us from thesummer picnics and baseball games out in the real world, had been diagnosedwith leukemia. Within minutes, a support group organized itself online. Someoneon the network, Phil quickly learned, always seemed to be awake and willingto read a father's late-night anxieties.  Two were physicians. And two werelong-term adult survivors of the same disease. Anyone who wants to preachthat  Cyberspace is cold and alienating is invited to argue that propositionwith Phil and his family.<p>And I remember KJ,  a strong and often abrasive online voice who announced two summersago that she was going to die by August. The messages of supportthat poured online brought many real-world tears. But tears are cheap. Inprivate e-mail, more than a dozen of us organized a visitation schedule. Wesat with her, read to her, just kept her company. She did die that summer.But she did not die alone. Who dares declare KJ's dying to be inauthentic,because the people who helped her die had met her online and knew her firstand best there?<p>It doesn't take an engineering degree to understand the power of computernetworks: Plug your machine into a phone line and you get a radically newmedium. How far that will take us is conjecture.  "With networked computers,"MIT professor Sherry Turkle writes in "Life On the Screen: Identity in the Ageof the Internet," "people are creating alternative identities, formingdisembodied relationships and building imaginary places that are beginningto interest and involve us as much as those in the physical world."  Mycomputer screen will never look quite the same again.<p>It's no accident that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects therights of citizens to communicate. We now have a medium of communication thatmight shift some of the power to inform and persuade from the mass media tothe grass roots. Let's not lose it through ignorance and misinformation. If wedo, Cyberspace could indeed become that cold place the scaremongers proclaim.Online technology is a tool that can build and exercise the power ofcitizens. But it is up to us to use the tools before we lose them.<p></font><BR><BR><font size=2><a href="http://www.well.com/user/hlr">Howard Rheingold</a>  is the author of "The VirtualReality and Virtual Community."
