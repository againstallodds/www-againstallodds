But in the global environment, where change is alwayspressing its foot on the accelerator, those 1,440 precious minutescan be a lifetime. In the time it takes to complete this first <A HREF="http://www.cyber24.com" target=_top><B>24 Hours in Cyberspace</B></A>, <AHREF="http://www.ran.org/ran/info_center/wrr/index.htm"  target=_top>31,507 acresof rain forest</A> will be destroyed, <AHREF="http://www.whitehouse.g../EOP/OSTP/NSTC.enr/enr-suc2.htm" target=_top>74species</A> will vanish, <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.g../EOP/OVP/24hours/vpenv.htm" target=_top>16million tons of carbon</A> will be pumped into the air and people willgenerate more than <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.g../EOP/OVP/24hours/garbage.htm" target=_top>700,000 tons of garbage. </A><P> <CENTER><appletcode="Countdown2.class" width=369 height=300> </applet></CENTER><P>That's the bad news.<P>     The good news is Cyberspace equips us with a new set of tools to respond tothese threats. The <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Presentations/Carle/TofC.htm" target=_top>Internet</A> and other new informationtechnologies cannot turn back the ecological clock, of course. But they can helpenvironmental scientists push back the frontiers of knowledge and help ordinary citizensgrasp the urgency of preserving our natural world.  <P>     Cyberspace, for instance, is deepening citizens' understanding of the globalenvironment. Through programs like <A HREF="http://www.globe.gov/" target=_top>GLOBE</A>, which PresidentClinton and I launched two years ago, students from all over the world are aiding thescientific community by taking environmental measurements in their communities andreporting their findings over the Internet. The kids learn from the experts, and the expertslearn from the kids.<P>     Indeed, growing numbers of children are now plugging into resources once availableonly to leading scientists. In classrooms around the country, teachers are employing multimedia presentations to simplify complex environmental and scientific concepts. For instance, someschools are using <A HREF="http://sun1.cr.usgs.gov/dclass/dclass.htm" target=_top>previously classified images from spy satellites</A> that showthe extent of environmental degradation in certain portions of the world. Imagine: theseextraordinary images have migrated from the government's secret files to the desktops ofAmerica's schoolchildren.<P>     The larger consequence is equally significant: Information on stewardship of the<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.g../EOP/OVP/24hours/earth.gif" target=_top>Earth</A> is no longer limited tothe experts. Inhabitants of almost every nation on the planet can get rich, detaileddata about the environment. For example, visitors to the <A HREF="http://www.usgs.gov/" target=_top>United States Geological Survey Homepage</A> can monitor deforestation in Amazonia andSoutheast Asia by viewing actual color images beamed from satellites. <P>     In addition to democratizing information, Cyberspace enhances the ability of expertsto learn from each other. No longer does it take a major international conference to bringthe <A HREF="gopher://gopher.undp.org:../ungophers/popin/unfpa/swp95/english/summary">world's</A>leading scientists together to share insights or collaborate on strategies.  Online communicationallows a group of scientists to work together and exchange data, even if the men andwomen of the group are sitting in different countries.  Some scholars regularly participate indiscussion groups to debate thorny global issues.  Using this cost-effective and time-efficient approach, researchers can spend more time and resources on finding facts andless time exchanging data and traveling from place to place.<P>     Here's an example of this new approach to science: Pat Ellison, a geologist from the<A HREF="http://www.si.edu" target=_top>Smithsonian Institution</A> in Washington, D.C., was recently conducting astudy on environmental and landscape factors affecting rivers in eastern and central Africa. Unable to find experts on the issue in Washington, D.C., she submitted a request throughthe Internet on the <A HREF="http://www.Achilles.Net/holiday/acn/acnhome.htm" target=_top>Aquatic Conservation Network</A>, an online community of scientists. Within 24 hours she received five responses from researchers in Europe, North Americaand northern and southern Africa who were either authorities on East African rivers or wereable to provide information on how to contact experts in the region.  By reaching out tothis emerging virtual world, she was able to secure the information she needed to completeher research.<P>     Such knowledge is important for its own sake, of course.  But it is also importantbecause knowledge is so often the prelude to action.  History has shown that people armedwith information about their world understand the urgency of protecting it and are morewilling to act.  After all, it was information in the form of <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.g../EOP/OVP/24hours/carson.htm" target=_top>Rachel Carson's brilliant"Silent Spring"</A> that helped ignite a generation of environmental action.  Cyberspace canhave a similar impact.  For example, under right-to-know laws that  require pollutersto disclose emissions of toxic chemicals to the public, a citizen with access to a publiclibrary or a home Internet connection can discover if any pollutants are being released intothe air or land in their neighborhoods. It's called the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/enviro.tris/tris_overview.htm" target=_top>toxic release inventory</A>, and online activists areusing it to keep their neighborhoods safe and clean.  What's more,  this local activism isforging links between citizens who live in different communities -- sometimes evendifferent continents -- who share common concerns.<P>     Cyberspace is also yielding new techniques for addressing environmental concerns --for example, natural disasters like the recent flooding on the U.S. East Coast andvolcanic eruptions like <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/sircxsar/pinatubo2.htm" target=_top>the Philippines' Mount Pinatubo</A> that disrupt ecosystems and unleash environmental devastation.  Or consider <A HREF="http://www.vita.org" target=_top>Volunteers In Technical Assistance (VITA)</A>. This group used satellite communications for an electronic mail system that tracked the spread of the <A HREF="http://www.who.ch/ebola/ebolahome.htm" target=_top>ebola virus</A> in Zaire and across Africa.<P>     At the same time, Cyberspace is helping avert environmental problems in the firstplace.  As more people use their computers to work at home, <A HREF="http://picard.aero.hq.nasa.gov/" target=_top>fewer cars</A> rumble across our highways and pollute our air. In the course of these 24 hours, for example, more than amillion gallons of gas will be saved because people choose to telecommute instead of drive. The same is true for video conferencing, which also cuts company costs and reducescommunity pollution.  And offices themselves are reducing the amount of paper they useas e-mail replaces paper mail and company "intranets" replace interoffice memorandums.  By the end of this day, some 16 million e-mail messages will criss-cross the globe, and asalways, I'll be contributing to that total.<P><CENTER><applet code="Countdown3.class" width=310 height=80></applet></CENTER><P>     But more than delivering information to scientists, equipping citizens with newtools to improve their world and making offices cheaper and more efficient, Cyberspace isachieving something even more enduring and profound: It's changing the very way wethink. It is extending our reach, and that is transforming our grasp.      Just as the car extended the power of our feet and the television extended thepower of our eyes, new computing and information technologies are extending the powerof our brains. We can now cast our minds into previously uncharted waters and usemodeling and visualization to navigate these seas. And as we explore this larger world, weachieve a new relationship with our natural world. What we consider our environmentreaches beyond our back yards, beyond even the immediate realm of our senses.   <P>     By enlisting Cyberspace to change the way we think, we are creating the conditionsfor changing the way we act. And that is literally changing our world.<P>     Not bad for a day's work -- even for 24 hours in Cyberspace.<P></font><br><br><br><br><a href= ../htm3/tocear.htm><IMG SRC=../assets/assets2/footers/earessy.gif  align=center valign=top width=365 height=49 border=0></a>                </td>        </tr> </table></td></tr></table><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>					<FONT SIZE=1>				<center><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0" VSPACE=50><BR>				&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
