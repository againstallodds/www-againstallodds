On the Net, no one knowsif you're Hungarian or African, whether you wear sandals or Guccis, drive aPorsche or ride a camel. <p>Needless to say, that  hasn't happened.  That earlier vision was colored moreby satellite television wrapping the planet in CNN and MTV than by thetwo-way interactivity of the Internet.  The Net reflects local culture and isbuilt on active participation by people everywhere; it doesn't simply beamthe same stuff impartially all over the world.  It offers the same thing toeveryone, everywhere  --  those who are connected, anyway. But then it's up toindividuals to make use of it.  And that's where the gaps are still great.<p>Of course, amazing stories abound.  American inner-city kids who get onto theNet and out of the ghetto  --  or stick around and use it to make thingsbetter.  And there are my friends in Central Europe and Russia, who arrangeprogramming gigs by e-mail and start up Web sites with no capital. <p>But you can't just give people access to information and expect to changeanything meaningfully.  The industrial-age equivalent would be distributingmachinery with no source of power. Education is the crucial ingredient toactually using the Net's free content and redistributed knowledge.  Andspreading learning around is far more difficult -- not to mention,expensive -- than simply wiring schools. Especially in places that are poor and poorly educated -- most of Africa, for instance, a continent with fewer Netconnections than many U.S. cities.<p>Eastern Europeans, by contrast, are by and large well-educated. They may bedisadvantaged by geography, by recent history and by the chaotic surroundingculture  But once they manage to fight their way onto the Net they can holdtheir own. Formidable barriers remain -- language, infrastructure, even themodest capital needed to operate online. Even so, it's easier to join theinformation economy from Moscow than, from, say, a disadvantaged home inAppalachia.  Let alone a tin-roofed shack on the outskirts of Lima.<p>But  especially for people long cut off from mainstream global culture, theattraction is overwhelming. Those of us in the West can easily forget howmagical this system is.  In North America or Western Europe, there are manyway to get whatever information you want, with or without the Internet.  Butin Tashkent or Tallin or even Moscow itself, the Net may be literally the onlysource. And things like slow access or bad connections are a minorinconvenience compared with waiting weeks or months for a book or preciousdocument -- or simply not being able to get some crucial piece of informationat all.  <p>I started using e-mail in 1989, not to communicate with other leading-edgepeople in the United States -- I could get them easily enough  by telephone -- but toexchange messages with programmers and budding businessmen I had met inRussia. I remember when a man called Leo Tomberg in Estonia established thefirst connection between Russia's then-UUCP network and the Internet, via agateway in Finland. It was like a hole in a dike, and information rushedthrough... in both directions. <p>Today that same pent-up desire describes millions of people living on themargins of global civilization, and yearning to be a part of the biggerworld. The Internet is a ladder that can get them there --  but only for thosewho can figure out how to climb.  <p></font><BR><BR><font size=2>Esther Dyson, who chairs the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is the president of EDventure Holdings, and co-founder of Poland Online. </font><br><br><br><br><a href= ../htm3/toctht.htm><IMG SRC=../assets/assets2/footers/fastessy.gif  align=center valign=top width=360 height=40 border=0></a>                 </td>        </tr> </table></td></tr></table><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>					<FONT SIZE=1>				<center><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0" VSPACE=50><BR>				&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
