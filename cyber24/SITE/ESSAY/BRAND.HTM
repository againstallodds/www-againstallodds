The thrill of having sophisticated computer power onyour desktop turned out to be just the beginning, once your machine couldconnect to everyone else's via telephone lines. There is a global computerthe size of humanity taking shape.<p>Now that everybody can publish their own interests to a world audience on theNet, we learn irreversibly that the world is far stranger and moreinteresting that we would ever guess from magazines, books and broadcastmedia.  Our sense of the world is altered and, oddly enough, in anoptimistic direction.<p>Two simple-seeming devices -- search engines and links -- have madesearch-space on the Internet more exciting than outer space. It is morecurrent and diverse than any encyclopedia, and it's inhabited with real people.However remote-seeming your query with a search service like Alta Vista,within minutes you find yourself on the home page of someone who has madethat subject their life's obsession.  What he or she has to say raisesquestions you would never have thought to ask. And they provide links toeven more astounding sources.<p>Web surfers experience a giddy sensation of boundless variety and boundlesspossibility.<p>How the world talks to itself is permanently changed. In the jargon, ithas shifted from one-to-one (telephone) and one-to-many (broadcast) tomany-to-many (the Net).  Power is taken from the editors and distributorsin huge over-cautious corporations and handed to no-longer-passive, radicaleveryone.  Individuals on the Net initiate and control content tosuit themselves and those they can interest.  (This makes governmentsnervous.)<p>The Net is an antidote to broadcast news.  The news tells you about a shockingearthquake and you're depressed.  The Net gives you the people who arehelping the earthquake victims and provides firsthand reports: "I was outin the garden when it hit, and I noticed that suddenly the ground wascovered with earthworms."<p>Some have described most activity on the Net as merely "vanity publishing"or "advertising."  Those are left-over broadcast terms whose meaningis changed in the Net environment.  Grass-roots "advertising" is whatassembles new communities of interest and whole new ecologies of knowledge.If we had any idea how wildly interesting "vanity publishing" could bewhen it is cheap and plentiful, we would never have condemned it.<p>Some call the Net "democratic."  It is certainly empowering andpolitical, but in a new sense.  People are not using the net to vote onissues (though they may soon) or to elect representatives in a hierarchicalpower structure.  They are using the Net to make things happen directly,personally, immediately.<p>"Here comes everybody," James Joyce wrote in "Finnegan's Wake" to summarizewhat the 20th century would bring.  Media visionary Marshall McLuhanchanted his statement like a mantra.  The Net has made it real.  In acascade, here comes everybody.</font size><p><BR><BR><font size=2>Stewart Brand is cofounder of Global Business Network, The WELL and the Hackers' Conference.  He is also author of "The Media Lab" and "How Buildings Learn."</font><br><br><br><br><a href= ../htm3/tocitl.htm><IMG SRC=../assets/assets2/footers/bettessy.gif  align=center valign=top width=366 height=51 border=0></a>                </td>        </tr> </table></td></tr></table><table width=450>	<tr>		<td>					<FONT SIZE=1>				<center><IMG SRC="../assets/assets2/cleardot.gif" ALIGN=TOP WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" BORDER="0" VSPACE=50><BR>				&copy;1996 24 Hours In Cyberspace, Inc.
