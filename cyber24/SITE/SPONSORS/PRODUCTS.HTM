N February 8, hundreds of professional photojournalists were dispatched
around the globe in order to shoot stories and images of how people are using
Cyberspace. All of these photographers used Kodak color negative film,
some used Kodak  DCS series digital cameras.
</P>

<P>
For those photographers using digital cameras, the high-quality images were 
transmitted via modem & laptop computer back to Mission Control in
San Francisco, where a team of top editors from leading publications
edited the images and stories, then uploaded them instantly to a web
site, which was viewed by over 4 million people.
</P>

<P>
For those photographers using film, they went to the nearest Kodak PhotoCD Imaging Workstation (PIW)
 service provider in the particular city they were in to process, scan, and digitize the film, 
 and transmit the images back to mission control using Kodak's PIW equipment.
(Find your nearest PhotoCD transfer site.)
</P>

<P>
Back in Mission Control, the editors printed proofs on 
Kodak XLS 8600 PS thermal printers 
in order to ensure the best possible quality images appeared on the Internet. 
Mission Control was also a beta site for Kodak's new poster-size printer, 
which was used to print souvenir copies of the Cyberspace event images for 
visiting press and media.

A Kodak PIW was used in Mission Control in order to demonstrate to the press and media how the 
images were scanned and sent from all over the world to Mission Control instantly. This PIW 
will also be used to scan the pictures that will eventually appear in the coffee-table book 
and CD-ROM Rick Smolan will release about the event in Oct. '96.
</P>

<P>
Kodak loaned 10 DC50 digital cameras to be used in Mission Control in order to document the events prior to and on the day of 
the "24 Hours in Cyberspace" event on Feb. 8. Also, visiting media and celebrities were 
loaned DC50's in order to shoot their digital images and upload them on the 
"24 Hours in Cyberspace" web page.
