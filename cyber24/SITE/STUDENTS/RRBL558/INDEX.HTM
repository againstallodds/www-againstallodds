For the kids at Industry School, a correctional facility for boys outside Rochester, New York, it may provide even more: contact with the outside world, connection with a potentially intimidating academic setting, and perhaps even a sense of hope.<br></table><img src="bar.gif"><table width=468 cellpadding=0 marginwidth=0><tr><td valign=bottom>More than a hundred boys age thirteen to seventeen live at Industry.

Since then they have carried on discussions via these e-mail accounts, on one occasion with RIT president Albert Simone, and on a regular basis with several RIT students.<br><br>This year another group of six Industry kids came to visit and establish accounts. RIT has provided additional support in the form of technology, and as a result Industry, in the words of program-founder John Sturges, has jumped from having the sparse facilities of "one, sometimes working computer," to boasting "a well equipped computer lab."<br><br></td></tr><tr><td><img src="indboard.gif"><br><br></td></tr><tr><td>The connection between Industry and RIT not only exposes the kids to the world of electronic communications; it has introduced them to an academic community and shown them that they more options than returning to the streets - even attending college. Only three percent of Industry's inmates will avoid jail as adults. The RIT connection hopes to see ten percent of Industry's boys go on to college. <br><br></td></tr></table><br><br><hr><font size=2><center><b>Photos</b><br>Sylwia Kapuscinski<br> Romain Blanquart<br>James Cheng<br><br><b>Text</b> <br>Eve Ogden<br><br><b>HTML Coding and Design</b> <br>Dave Vedder</center></font>
