Zundel believes his mission is the rehabilitation of the honor and reputation of Germany and its people.  He therefore denies that the Nazi regime exterminated six million Jews. M<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOpening <b>Ernst Zundel</b>&#39;s website one can choose from several headings that range from &quot;Auschwitz: Myths and Facts&quot; and &quot;66 Questions to Answers on the Holocaust&quot; to &quot;Censorship in America - by Germany&quot;.  </TD><TD align = center  width=42%> <IMG SRC="photo2.gif"></td></TR></TABLE> <TABLE width =540 table cellpadding=20 border=0> <TR>  <TD align = left  width=50%>Each topic lists accounts and findings that Zundel maintain prove his argument. Surprisingly, most of his websites are linked to Nizkor, a website dedicated to the nearly 12 million victims of Adolf Hitler and his Nazi regime.<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mainstream press is closed to Zundel&#39;s views and without the internet his voice is small.    He supports the net &quot;because it is global, instant, and virtually universally accessible, and uses a universal techno-speak language, which will revolutionize the thinking of the world.&quot;&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFreedom of speech and access to information are fundamental principles in free societies. Zundel says that &quot;control of information    has always led to the control of people.  The Internet if left uncensored can lead to global liberation through information.  <b>Our websites are our training wheels to freedom.</b></TD> <TD align=left  valign=top width=50%> 	Through it, we can win or defend all our liberties.&quot;	Zundel states, &quot;The uncensored interchange or free flow of ideas, not managed or packaged by information brokers or quasi-censors, will for the first time in written  or recorded history level the playing field.  It will and must lead to the democratization of information! Humble people without university degrees will be offering their ideas on an even, almost value neutral,&quot;info-bahn&quot;.  Suppressed and ignored, and even prosecuted thinkers will be heard by millions at an instant!  No wonder information and power brokers, governments for instance, are scared!&quot;   &nbsp&nbsp&nbspErnest Zundel lives in Canada and is currently facing prosecution for promoting hatred towards Jews and defamatory libel.</TD></TR></TABLE> <BR><BR><center>Photography and text by Arabella Schwarzkopf</center> </H5><center>E-mail address is AAS6307 @RIT.edu</center> </H5><center>Web Design created by Craig A.
