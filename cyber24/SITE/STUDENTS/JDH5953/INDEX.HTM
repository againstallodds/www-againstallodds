I&#39;m actually kind of satisfied with plain old &quot;Julie.&quot;</p> 		<p>One day, I was fooling around on the computer with my school&#39;s library research system, and I thought that it might be fun to look up other Julies. Not just any other Julies, but people like me,<br> Julie Hendersons. </p>		<p>Although not terribly accurate, the phonedisc program spit out a couple hundred Julia and Julie Hendersons.  Before the librarian returned, I&#39;d printed out all the addresses of my namesakes. It took all the paper in the printer.  </p>	<p>For weeks I described my dream project to my classmates: to travel around the country interviewing and photographing Julie Hendersons. 24 Hours in Cyberspace gave me an excuse to start a lifelong project - finding other people just like me.</b></p>			</center>		</td>			<td valign=top>		<center><h5>This year, I can confidently say that I found myself. <br> Over a hundred times,in 			   fact.</h5><br></center>		<pre>                                                   </pre>		<center> <img src="self.gif" border=2><br>Julia D.

I was twenty-nine by the time I got married.  I thought, I can&#39;t be Julie Bernard, I&#39;m Julie Henderson. I was really tied to that.  I think that part of it is that my dad had three daughters, so there was nowhere that our name was going to go, technically anyway. When my dad found out that I wasn&#39;t going to change my name, I thought that he was going to get up and do a little dance of joy.&quot;</p><pre>                                                          </pre>		<p>&quot;Something that has made a really big impact on me was working with people in my research study who had HIV and AIDS. A lot of them were of the attitude  that you have to make the most of everything, and just do what you want to do. It puts a whole different light on things.  You realize not to waste time doing stuff just because you feel like you have to do it, or because some tells you that you have to do it. Do what you want to do; do what feels right.&quot;</p>	</center>		</td>	<td valign=center>		<pre>                                           </pre>			<center><img src="oshkosh.gif" border=2><br>Dr. Julie K.

I have a friend whose last name is Henderson, and he&#39;s black.  We were talking one time about where our names came from.  I told him that my grandparents had come from Norway.  His name came from his grandfather who had been a slave, and he had been owned by a Henderson.  The slave had taken the owner&#39;s name. When I think of my name, that&#39;s my heritage. I think of Norway and the people that came from there.  For him, all that had been lost.  It broke my heart and it made me sick at the same time, to think that there had been a Henderson at some point and time that owned slaves.&quot;	</p>	</center>			</td>		<td>			<pre> 	    </pre>			</td>					<td>				<pre>                                                     </pre>				<center><ul><b>Julia Slaydon Henderson </B> <A NAME="JULIA SLAYDON HENDERSON"><br>		Cincinnatti, OH <br>		40 years old <br>		Occupation: Trains daycare facility workers<br>					Runs Cincinnatti area daycare center<br>		Education:  B.A. in Home Economics Edu.,<br> Blufton College<br>					B.A. in Child Development, Blufton College <br>					Masters in Early Childhood Edu.,<br>Northern Kentucky Univ. <br>		Religion: Episcopalian<br>		Favorite Color: blue<br>		New Year&#39;s Resolution: none <br>				</ul>		<p>&quot;The adoption of my daughter definitely affected my life.  I adopted because I wanted to parent, and I wasn&#39;t married.  I have hemophilia, and I knew that I was probably never going to carry a child biologically.  So I searched and searched, and I found an adoption agency in Texas that would place babies in your home as long as you are willing to take a Hispanic child.&quot; </P>	 				</P></center>				</td>				<td valign=top>				<pre>                                              </pre>					<center><img src="cinci.gif" border=2> Julia S. Henderson<br>				<p>&quot;The adoption was my biggest change or decision.  Especially when you&#39;re crossing racial lines. There was a lot of 'are you sure you want to do this?' type of thing.  I just have a strong commitment that all children deserve homes. 	 		It has made us a trans-racial family, and a lot of times, there are a lot of preconceived notions about racial identities. When I met my husband, who is black, we ran into a lot of things. People automatically assume that we don&#39;t have educations, of which we both definitely do. They think we are a little less than what the 'natural' family should be.&quot;		</center> 		</td>			</tr></table></body></html>
