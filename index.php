On Friday, July 11, 1997, one hundred of the world's leading photojournalists fanned out to every corner of the globe to illustrate how modern computing technology influences nearly every aspect of our lives in the course of a single day.<p>



The 4004 microprocessor was originally invented by Intel engineers to power simple calculators over 25 years ago. Today the microprocessor, and the technology based on it, is woven into the fabric of civilization in a variety of ways which most of us never suspect.  The modern microprocessor -- and the countless applications it has made possible -- has extended the powers of the computer to previously unimaginable places, affecting a wide range of human endeavors from health, education, and entertainment to religion and communication.

<font size=3><b>Special offer on <a href="cyber24.htm">24 Hours in Cyberspace</a></b>

<p>





On February 8, 1996 Rick Smolan and Jennifer Erwitt sent 150 photographers all over the world with 9,000 rolls of film and a question: What is the nature of Cyberspace and how is it affecting human encounters?

<p>

Armed with both digital and conventional film cameras, the photographers developed, edited, scanned and transmitted some of their pictures that day to Mission Control in San Francisco. There, a support staff of 160 picture editors, writers, designers and programmers designed a sophisticated World Wide Web site in real time. In effect, the project used the Internet to document the Internet and then published the results, where else but on the Internet? 

<p>

In February, the online world saw only a small portion of the photographs taken that day. In the following weeks, thousands of additional rolls of film arrived at headquarters, where a second team of picture editors culled the best for inclusion in a 224-page hardcover coffee-table book.

<p>

Despite the cutting-edge technology involved, it appears that what people desire most is a place to find others like themselves and the things that fascinate them. Smolan argues that the photographs capture &quot;the awesome power that one human being can have on another through the mere act of communication.&quot;
